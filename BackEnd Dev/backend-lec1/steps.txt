1--> npm init -y 
    creates a package.json file

2--> npm install express

3--> create a file server.js

4--> node server.js 
    runs server.js file at localhost:specified port

5--> we can verify/see get request from browser by client but for a post request we can not see it on browser so we use a testing tool called postman

6--> install postman
    paste post req url localhost:3000/api/cars in postman and in body under raw send json dummy data
    {
        "name":
        "brand":
    }

7--> now when you send above post req at server error occures can't read property

8--> hence we need a bodyparser/express.json() so that server able to parse/read json data sent by client

9--> install mongodb community server, mongodbshell(CLI for handling db) and mongodbcompass(GUI for handling )
    In terminal
        s1. mongosh --version       to see current version

10--> open compass and connect to localdb hosted on localhost:27017
    create a db ---> Cars ---> collection named ---> mahindra

11--> inside collection mahindra add dummy document/data as {name:__, brand:__}

12--> use mongoose ---> which is used to link your mongo database to server. it is a middle layer(ODM-object data modeling library)
    can also use it for schema creation and validations -- etc.

13--> npm install mongoose  and connect server to database (ie localhost:27017/myDatabaseName) if defined db not present already then it create specified db
